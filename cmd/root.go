	Use:   "k8s-sync",
	Short: "Sync YAML or JSON resources against a k8s cluster",
	Long: `k8s-sync allows you to reconcile objects defined in a YAML or
JSON file (or a directory containing them) against a Kubernetes cluster following a GitOps pattern.

k8s-sync will try to create target resources against your current cluster context, and, if some of the object dependencies are not found on the cluster,
it will reapply failed objects against the cluster until success. If the state of your YAML/JSON resources is eventually
consistant, you should be good to go!`,
